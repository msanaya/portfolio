I will write some great placeholder text – and nobody writes better placeholder text than me, believe me – and I’ll write it very inexpensively. I will write some great, great text on your website’s Southern border, and I will make Google pay for that text. Mark my words. You’re disgusting. Some people have an ability to write placeholder text... It's an art you're basically born with. You either have it or you don't.</p>
